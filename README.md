# Etch-a-Sketch

Build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

- [x] Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
- [x] Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
- [x] Add a button on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed, and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g., 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad.
- [ ] Force selected "pixel" per side to be a factor of 960. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 32, 40, 48, 60, 64, 80, 96.)
- [ ] Make shake animation when clearing.
- [ ] Add rainbow mode.
- [ ] Add progressive darkening mode.
- [ ] Make mobile friendly.
